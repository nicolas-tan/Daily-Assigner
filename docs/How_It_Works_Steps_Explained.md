# Daily Bug Assignment Automation - Complete Breakdown

## üîÑ Order of Operations & Process Flow

### One-Time Setup (You only do this ONCE):
1. Run `./setup_cron_browser.sh`
   - Creates virtual environment
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Sets up Chrome driver
   - **Creates a cron job that runs forever**
   - Creates `run_browser_automation.sh` wrapper script

### Daily Automatic Process (Runs by itself at 9:30 AM PST):
1. **Cron triggers** ‚Üí `run_browser_automation.sh`
2. **Wrapper script** ‚Üí Activates venv & runs `script_browser_automation.py`
3. **Browser automation** ‚Üí Downloads sheets, processes, uploads, sends email
4. **Logs results** ‚Üí `daily_assigner.log`

## üìÅ File-by-File Breakdown

### 1. `setup_cron_browser.sh` - The Setup Script
**Purpose**: One-time setup that creates the automation infrastructure

```

## üîÑ How Cron Works (The Magic Behind Automation)

### What is Cron?
- A time-based job scheduler in Unix/Linux
- Runs commands at specified times/dates
- Works in the background as a system service

### Your Cron Job:
```bash
30 9 * * * cd /home/nitan/Daily-Assigner && ./run_browser_automation.sh
```

**Translation**:
- `30 9` = At 9:30 AM
- `* * *` = Every day, every month, every day of week
- `cd /home/nitan/Daily-Assigner` = Go to your project folder
- `./run_browser_automation.sh` = Run the automation

### Important Cron Behavior:
1. **Runs only when computer is ON**
   - If computer is off at 9:30 AM ‚Üí Job doesn't run
   - If computer is sleeping ‚Üí Job doesn't run
   - If computer is on ‚Üí Job runs ‚úÖ

2. **Persists across reboots**
   - Cron jobs are saved permanently
   - Survive computer restarts
   - No need to set up again

3. **Missed jobs**
   - Standard cron does NOT run missed jobs
   - If computer was off at 9:30 AM, job is skipped
   - Consider `anacron` for catch-up functionality

## üöÄ Complete Setup Process (Do This Once)

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/nitan/Daily-Assigner
   ./setup_cron_browser.sh
   # Choose option 1 (PST/PDT)
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   nano .env
   ```
   Add:
   ```
   TARGET_SHEET_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_TARGET_ID
   SOURCE_SHEET_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SOURCE_ID
   EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=team@nvidia.com,manager@nvidia.com
   ```

3. **Test It Works**:
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Test the automation
   python script_browser_automation.py
   ```

4. **Verify Cron Job**:
   ```bash
   # See your cron jobs
   crontab -l
   
   # Should show:
   # 30 9 * * * cd /home/nitan/Daily-Assigner && ./run_browser_automation.sh
   ```

## üìä Daily Operation (Automatic)

Every day at 9:30 AM PST (when computer is on):

1. **9:30:00** - Cron wakes up
2. **9:30:01** - Launches Chrome browser
3. **9:30:05** - Downloads Target Google Sheet
4. **9:30:10** - Downloads Source Google Sheet  
5. **9:30:15** - Processes bugs (script.py):
   - Merges new bugs
   - Assigns to teams
   - Sorts by priority
   - Distributes to team sheets
6. **9:30:20** - Uploads updated sheet back
7. **9:30:25** - Takes screenshots of tabs 2,3,4
8. **9:30:30** - Opens Outlook with email ready
9. **9:30:35** - Logs completion

## üîß Maintenance & Monitoring

### Check if it's running:
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -f daily_assigner.log

# Check cron job exists
crontab -l

# See if process is running (at 9:30 AM)
ps aux | grep script_browser_automation
```

### If computer was off:
```bash
# Run manually
cd /home/nitan/Daily-Assigner
source venv/bin/activate
python script_browser_automation.py
```

### To stop automation:
```bash
# Remove cron job
crontab -l | grep -v 'run_browser_automation.sh' | crontab -
```

### To change time:
```bash
# Edit cron job
crontab -e
# Change 30 9 to whatever you want (e.g., 0 10 for 10:00 AM)
```

## üéØ Key Points

1. **You run setup ONCE** - The cron job persists forever
2. **Computer must be ON** - Not sleeping, not shut down
3. **Automatic every day** - No manual intervention needed
4. **Email opens in Outlook** - Just attach files and send
5. **Logs everything** - Check daily_assigner.log for issues

The beauty is: after initial setup, you never touch it again. It just runs every morning at 9:30 AM automatically!
